## Facial Emotion Detector
- Web app that detects your face emotions using AI and matches them with emojis.
- Built using ReactJS and face-API.js
- Face-API.js is a JavaScript API for face detection and face recognition in the browser implemented on top of the tensorflow.js core API.
- Version 2.0

## About this project
The main objective was very simple, to display emojis based on the facial expressions that we make in front of our camera.

Once the app detects your face, it will do two things:
- Change the background color.
- Replace the default emoji with the one that it thinks is the best match to your expression.

Face-API.js was used to faciliate this process. You can read more about it [here](https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/).

**Note**: You are not being recorded at any point, it all happens in your own browser!

## Taking a look inside
I'm going to take Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, as an example to showcase the site. 

Very straightforward. 

Whenever he smiles, the emoji turns into a lauging emoji, and the background color changes to green.

On the other side,

If he looks angry, the app will also catch that and display the right emoji and background color.

Same thing happens whenever his facial expression might look a bit neutral. 

The emoji gets changed, and the background color gets updated as well.

## Other notes
For this app to properly work, make sure that:
- Your room has good lighting
- Your face is close enough to the computer
- And that you give it a few seconds after your camera is loaded, so that it can accurately detect your face
